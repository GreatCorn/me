		<P>The first one to be collaborating in GreatCorn's videos, Lightning was his close friend for a long time. Their first video was an <A href="https://youtu.be/en34d5p9-ss">SCP - Containment Breach let's play</A>. When they were young, their mothers were close friends too and often someone would visit the other.</P>
		<P>Lightning studied at the same school as GreatCorn, but was a year younger than him. They often liked to play games from the Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Kombat series, as these were Lightning's favorite games. Lightning has a younger brother, Alyosha, who very often appeared in videos due to him also visiting GreatCorn's home along with Lightning.</P>
		<P>Their first visual appearance was in the <A href="https://youtu.be/c4DKTTo95DU">Немного веселья с Никитой</A> video. During that period they were close friends with GreatCorn.</P>
		<P>Lightning and his brother helped a lot in the development of <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan.html">Kurlykistan</A>. When choosing a <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan.html">Kurlykistan</A> avatar, Lightning became a Lithuanian parrot, his brother a Russian woodpecker. On 08.08.2017 he created his own YouTube channel on which he posted a single introduction video which was later made unlisted or deleted.</P>
		<P>After GreatCorn quit school, they began seeing each other on special occasions. After that, Lightning and his brother quit the Kurlykistan Viber group and then they rarely talked to each other. It was not because of a conflict or anything negative, just due to the flow of events.</P>
