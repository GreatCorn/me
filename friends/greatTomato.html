		<P>Full name and picture not publicly available due to personal request to remain a mysterious person. Tomato's speciality is mostly physics and math, though he can also do programming etc. He has his own YouTube channel, albeit rarely posting videos there.</P>
		<P>First met with GreatCorn being almost 6 years old in 1st grade of school. At first they weren't friends, and for some time didn't really aknowledge each other. Tomato attended bandura classes from the 2nd grade. True friendship with GreatCorn began at around 3rd-4th grade.</P>
		<P>Things get more widescale when at 5th grade, <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha Banasevych</A> joins their class. After some time forms a fraternity and a Viber group - MMJS, including Tomato, <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, GreatCorn and <A href="/me/friends/superS.html">Super S</A>. On 26.12.2016 Tomato creates his own YouTube channel. On that date was also created his most famous known profile picture. Great Tomato began making paper animations, though, unlike GreatCorn's, his were more of a hand-drawn style.</P>
		<P>His first public appearance on a video from GreatCorn's channel was on 28.01.2017, on a <A href="https://youtu.be/bnUJO4mLZXU">Roblox livestream</A> with <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>. Great Tomato begins making Lego animations about himself, his family and friends. Tomato quits the school GreatCorn and others were in after 7th grade. After that they begin rarely seeing each other.</P>
		<P>After the creation of <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/">Kurlykistan</A>, GreatCorn offers to join as a pigeon. Tomato declines the offer and founds the <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A> Airship.</P>
		<P>The friendship with GreatCorn grows stronger after the aforementioned graduates to college. They start seeing each other more often, after lessons or just on occasions.</P>
