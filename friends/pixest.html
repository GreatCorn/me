		<P>Mostly known for his art, Pixest first met GreatCorn while proposing some ambient tracks for SCP - Isolation. Due to the development difficulties at that time, none of the tracks were featured in any versions of the game. Soon GreatCorn quit development, but he and Pixest remained friends, with him sometimes appearing in the comment sections on GreatCorn's videos. Later Pixest developed his artistic skills and qualities, then starting to publicly post his (ocassionally NSFW) art, or at least between his friends on his Discord channel.</P>
