		<P>Misha's speciality is probably history and English, at least he's very good at those. His grandfather was a war veteran, so Misha has great knowledge of the Second World War and the Napoleonic Wars. He's also very fond of Titanic and knows much about it.</P>
		<P>Before 5th grade, Misha was studying in the school department of GreatCorn's kindergarten. He was friends with the former GreatCorn's group mates, some of which then went into the class GreatCorn was in after 4th grade.</P>
		<P>Misha first met with GreatCorn in 5th grade. They became good friends after. They united with <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A> and <A href="/me/friends/superS.html">Super S</A> in the MMJS group. His first video appearance on GreatCorn's channel was on 20.02.2016 in the <A href="https://youtu.be/iy-lQsLH5Og">Совсем чуть-чуть ROBLOX'a с Мишей</A> Roblox let's play, though his channel was created on 05.01.2013. He later starred in the unfinished SCP - The Breach novel by GreatCorn (2016-2017) with <A href="/me/friends/andrey.html">Andrey</A>. He tried making Roblox livestreams with GreatCorn and mostly <A href="/me/friends/ragy.html">Ragy</A>, but these were later deleted or made unlisted. Now his only public video on the channel is <A href="https://youtu.be/FdiucBwg9FM">Голосовой диктор Леново</A>, in which he laughes at Lenovo text-to-speech services.</P>
		<P>Misha studied C# development on programming courses. He also went on many history and English contests. Most of his latter novels featured the friends group, though often with different names (GreatCorn, <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Tomat</A>, <A href="/me/friends/andrey.html">Andrey</A>, <A href="/me/friends/superS.html">Super S</A>, <A href="/me/friends/ragy.html">Ragy</A>). An example is his unfinished "Iron Coffin", where the friends were German soldiers in WW2 and died in a submarine (something similar was attempted by GreatCorn at the end of 2019, though in a form of animation). In 2017 there was an attempt to make a Minecraft movie based on Misha's "Ravenswood Mansion" novel. This idea, however, wasn't successful fully.</P>
		<P>Misha helped when forming <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/">Kurlykistan</A> and his avatar was a Canadian crow (Voron Schnurok Kanadovich). Later he joined Nekoland and became Jewish Cat. His Cat transformation GreatCorn accounted for joining Tomatoland in the <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/">Kurlykistan</A> lore. Somewhere during that time he became close friends with <A href="/me/friends/dana.html">Dana</A>, later to become her boyfriend.</P>
