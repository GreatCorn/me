		<P>GreatCorn first met Ragy through <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>. They were playing Roblox together and GreatCorn joined up. After helping <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A> do some streams with Ragy (then nicknamed Lorai), GreatCorn started playing Roblox with him. Their most played game was Build a Boat for Treasure. There, Ragy got his title of "The Master of Glitches and Bugs" and "The Great DDoSer", as the way he exploited the game was remarkable. If a game was played with Ragy, it was guaranteed to be broken. His attitude can best described as chaotic and random. Later, <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A> followed in his "DDoSing" steps.</P>
		<P>Ragy was one of the first to establish Kurlykistan and, together with <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A> formed GreatCorn's nickname Vorobushek Blin Krevetovich. He was the one to promote Basya to a significant role in the lore and inside jokes. He was the one who started calling GreatCorn grechka (buckwheat, гречка), in turn GreatCorn called him ovsianka (oatmeal, овсянка).</P>
		<P>Ragy helped in the development of SCP - Isolation (<A href="https://youtu.be/j5pBVTnpcEQ">testing</A>, ideas), later helping a little with testing <A href="/me/work/87.html">87 - An Epilogue</A>.</P>
		<P>While playing Phasmophobia, Ragy introduced GreatCorn to CumCat and Assins (Stalker).</P>
