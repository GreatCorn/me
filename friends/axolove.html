		<HR>
		<P>Axolove was mostly known by his Hungarian SCP Foundation videos, reading SCP articles and making SCP-themed videos (including some let's-plays, Confinement series translation, etc). He studied art & animation, mostly 2D, some of his works are posted on his channel.</P>
		<P>First met on 14.01.2018 in Skype during the beginning of SCP - Isolation development, Axolove was the first one to respond to GreatCorn when he posted that the game was in a need of voice actors (second supporter of the game). He was the voice of 2 MTF operatives and Dr. Maynard. His contributions also included, but weren't limited to: art, ideas, inspiration. There were times when they played Minecraft together, in which Axolove was building an SCP site and Six-Eight-Two, which was recorded, but the video was lost. Axolove stayed through the entire SCP - Isolation development process until GreatCorn left the later formed team and then they remained friends, supporting each other.</P>
		<P>Axolove had a few times he was unsure in what his YouTube content should be and tried to restart his channel. He appeared in the comments of countless GreatCorn's videos, however, never in a single one directly. His voice could be heard in some SCP - Isolation videos. There is a video entirely with his voice from a Dr. Maynard line - <A href="https://youtu.be/70QbO1vZdxo">Crazy-ass Burnett</A>.</P>
		<P>GreatCorn once appeared in his animation titled "Ajándék lónak ne nézd a fogát!" (Don't look a gift horse in the mouth!) as a cameo, also a possible appearance was in his "A szám nélküli szoba" (The room with no number), on a wall beside the number 400.</P>
