		<P>Super S is a good and generous guy, who doesn't really like to be public. He's a bit rustic and has his likes in agriculture, guitar and also tries to experiment with hobbies from time to time. He never really appeared much in GreatCorn's videos, mostly just due to coincidences. His first appearance on GreatCorn's channel was probably in the <A href="https://youtu.be/sfq7-YIUc78">хороший клей</A> video, which was a cut of a livestream. His voice could be heard asking "May I ask?". He later appeared on GreatCorn's second channel, in the <A href="https://youtu.be/I6lDY7pDnwI">GreatCorn, October_ fest_ and Super S HL SFX</A> video, holding the camera. The video has its audio track completely replaced by Half-Life sound effects, but the original video was never posted to the public, in which Super S' voice could be heard.</P>
		<P>Starting from 1st grade, their friendship wasn't very strong, in some cases GreatCorn was an asshole to Super S. Later on their friendship got stronger and GreatCorn started truly appreciating Super S. Somewhere around 2014 GreatCorn wrote a novella, the "<A href="/me/work/hellsBook">Hell's Book</A>", in which Super S appeared as one of the main characters without much explanation. He creates his own YouTube channel at 29.10.2014 and later another at 28.01.2016.</P>
		<P>In 2015 Super S, along with GreatCorn and Erty E (who was their good pal in a period between 2014 and 2016) founded Sunrun Studio. They used it for their works, which wasn't much. Super S tried to keep it strong and labeled his school and public work with Sunrun Studio, but after some events, the team broke up. Later, after making friends with <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, a fraternity and a Viber group form - MMJS, including <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Tomato</A>, <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, GreatCorn and Super S.</P>
		<P>When offered a role (as a Ukrainian hen) in <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan.html">Kurlykistan</A>, Super S refused. <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan.html">Kurlykistan's</A> capital, Nazarium was named after Super S' relative.</P>
