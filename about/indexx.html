		<P>GreatCorn's real name is Yevhenii Ionenko and that is who I am. I most often identify myself as a pianist, composer, programmer and game dev, though I do many other things, albeit none of it is professional (except piano performing). A list of my works could be found on the <A href="/me/work/">MY WORK</A> page. I'm studying as a piano performer, though have many controversial thoughts about my profession, wanting to develop myself more and get time for self-disclosure. I like doing things myself, without relying on other people (such as many of my game projects and similar), sometimes I suffer from it, as it backfires with slow development processes and me getting tired.</P>
		<P>I was born on 22/01 in Ukraine, Kyiv. My mother was a Russian philologist by profession, my dad a bass player. I'm a single child in my family, but I also have an uncle, who has done a lot to make my childhood great and showed me the wonders of horror movies and South Park. My dad's jazz works influenced my music interest and my mom helped me become literate in my younger years.</P>
		<P>Since my early childhood I expressed interest towards music. Sometimes I went on my father's performances and concerts. He had a Yamaha synthesizer, which he sometimes would give me to play around with. It was pretty basic by today's standards, keys had no dynamics and the interface wasn't very refined, but for little me it was enough to get me busy for hours. My mom had some piano lessons in her teenage years, so we had some sheet music lying around and she knew a couple melodies. I was mostly into pop, though I also liked death metal and rolled on the floor happily whenever dad would turn it on the speakers.</P>
		<P>Around the time of my 1st grade I bought (a pirated copy on a disk of) my first videogame - Sonic Adventure DX. I became a big fan. Before that I was interested in computers and also comics. I was writing some about my cats - Basya and Musya. My grandmother lived in a village, in which we had 12 cats and 2 dogs by that time, but they rarely appeared in my works, albeit I visited the village quite often. So, I started writing quite cringe-worthy comics about Sonic. Around that time I also finished my first novel - "Big Fantasy", involving my friends, adventure and Minecraft.</P>

		<P>In my 2nd grade I applied to a music school. I can't remember much of my beginnings, but I guess I showed potential, though unorganized and a little chaotic. Yet I was an introvert from my early years and my shyness kept everything inside. My piano teacher saw my potential, I guess and after a couple of years I went to my first piano contest. Albeit being limited to my district, it was very much something special for me and after achieving 1st place I was in awe.</P>
		<P>My music teachers were great and invested so much of their time and effort into me. The collective of her pupils who attended the school alongside me was also very warm and friendly, though at first the 7 of us hung out separately – the 3 boys and 4 girls. Our teacher would later take us out in the city to visit some historical museums, where we performed music and interesting places in general. She had a very persistent character in her methodology of teaching, but that helped us be more confident and persistent ourselves. </P>
		<P>I, apparently, showed potential in musical theory too. I went through 3 solfeggio teachers throughout my 8 years in music school, the last of which helped me for 4 years to participate in solfeggio olympiads and on the last year – to go to the musical college in the Kyiv Municipal Academy of Music named after R.M. Glière. </P>
		<P>August 14, 2013. I create my YouTube channel. The first video was posted on October 12, 2014, involving playing Garry's Mod. Later, more mediocre gameplay videos followed. My first collaboration was with a friend of mine from music school, then nicknamed X-ray Romantik, who was a clarinetist. Then I did videos with <A href="/me/friends/lightningMivina.html">Lightning Mivina</A>, who has his own playlist on my channel. I made some piano videos, though most of them were posted on my mom's channel.</P>
		<P>Around 2016 I do my first attempts at piano composing. The pieces were simple, most of them just in my head, though I practiced sheet music writing and even wrote a piece, which is lost because of MuseScore's community site's limitations. My solfeggio teacher reacted neutrally, saying they were song-like and did some practice with me in harmonization, composing and improvisation. Around the end of 2017 I write my first later to be public piece – "<A href="/me/work/royaltyFreeMusic.html">Late Night Beer</A>". My grandmother who came to visit apparently really liked it and I continued writing more similar non-complex pieces. After attempting to show some works to my teacher I didn't get much praise, including a remark about mixed styles and lack of clear consistency. Not to say the teacher wasn't right, she was surprised, when I showed her "<A href="/me/work/sunsetRagtime.html">Sunset Ragtime</A>", which marked a turning point in my composing, as it was my first publicly performed piece (later at the start of the first year of college).</P>
