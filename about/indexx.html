		<P>GreatCorn's real name is Yevhenii Ionenko and that is who I am. I most often identify myself as a pianist, composer, programmer and game dev, though I do many other things, albeit none of it is professional. A list of my works could be found on the <A href="/me/work/">MY WORK</A> page. I'm studying as a piano performer, though have many controversial thoughts about my profession, wanting to develop myself more and get time for self-disclosure. I like doing things myself, without relying on other people (such as many of my game projects and similar), sometimes I suffer from it, as it backfires with slow development processes and me getting tired.</P>
		<P>I was born on 22/01 in Ukraine, Kyiv. My mother was a Russian philologist by profession, my dad a bass player. I'm a single child in my family, but I also have an uncle.</P>
		<P>Since my early childhood I expressed interest towards music. Sometimes I went on my father's performances and concerts. He had a Yamaha synthesiser. It was pretty basic by today's standards, keys had no dynamics and the interface wasn't very refined, but for little me it was enough to get me busy for hours. My mom had some piano lessons in her teenage years, so we had some sheet music lying around and she knew a couple melodies.</P>
		<P>Around the time of my 1st grade I bought (a pirated copy on a disk of) my first videogame - Sonic Adventure DX. I became a big fan. Before that I was interested in computers and also comics. I was writing some about my cats - Basya and Musya. My grandmother lived in a village, in which we had 12 cats and 2 dogs by that time, but they rarely appeared in my works, albeit I visited the village quite often. So, I started writing comics about Sonic. Around that time I also finished my first novel - "Big Fantasy", involving my friends, adventure and Minecraft.</P>

		<P>In my 2nd grade I applied to a music school. I can't remember much of my beginnings, but I guess I showed potential, though unorganized and a little chaotic. Yet I was an introvert from my early years and my shyness kept everything inside. Starting from humble beginnings, I made my way to my first piano exam, on which my performance of D. Kabalevsky's "Little Hedgehog" was listened by another teacher. After me poking the keys for some time, the other teacher asked mine: "Is this the 1st grade?". I thought I did very bad.</P>
