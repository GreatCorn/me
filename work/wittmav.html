		<P><B>DESCRIPTION: </B>An old attempt at making a long animation, that was going kinda good, but stopped and didn't continue ever since. Here's all that's got left from it. The audio sucks, the voice acting could be better, but overall it's not that bad.<BR>The film begins with meeting all the characters, two Mishas and me, Jenya. Later I get a comment that tells me to make videos, because I publish them very rarely. Everything cuts short when I get a text and a call from Misha, asking me to go outside. I can't refuse, because it's his birthday. Then he invites me to his home as a guest and the plot gets some turns and twists.</P>
