		<PRE>Brisk and jolly
Cheerful fella
Strolling swiftly
Down the streets.

He's unholy,
He's a felon:
Killed his wife and
Raped his kids.

Through their weeping,
Pain, and torture
He will prosper,
He will thrive.

Never seeking,
Never searching
For another,
Better life.

Brisk and jolly
Cheerful fella
Going 'round the
Outdoors.

Dying slowly
In the cellar
Children feed on
Mother's corpse.

No one knows he
Did the evil,
No one bats a
Watchful eye.

As below, the
Man is regal,
So above his
Fame is high.

Brisk and jolly
Cheerful fella
Sees the world in
Blue and brown.

Melancholy
Met him never,
No one seen him
Make a frown.

As is fated,
He has risen
To torment and
Make them plead,

Expiated,
And forgiven,
Going home to
Do the deed.

Brisk and jolly
Cheerful fella
Never was and
Never been.

Had he wholly
Been a dweller,
Not one soul would
Dare to sin.

We will wait for
His arrival,
We will yearn to
End the strife.

Through the death, or
Through survival
He shall reach our
Hopeless life.</PRE>
