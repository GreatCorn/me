		<P>Sometimes referred to as GreatCorn's Hell, the 10-Tier Hell or 87 Hell, it shows itself as somewhat of an reinterpretation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The structure combines the 9 circles of hell from Inferno and the 7 deadly sins from Purgatorio. The concept is used in GreatCorn's creations of many types - from music to digital artwork and videogames. GreatCorn also includes small concepts of his own Purgatorio and Paradiso.</P>
		<P>GreatCorn's hell begins similar to Dante's Inferno, except the first circle/tier is Acheron, then comes Limbo. The sixth circle, which according to the Divine Comedy should've been Wrath and Styx, becomes Sloth. Then, the positioning continues through by the 7 Deadly Sins and the 10th tier is Cocytus. Each circle has a theme, its guardian, icon, color and souls, suffering inside. However, that may differ in relation to the art form. In some forms, the guardians are not present (e.g. no need, as in sheet music). When they are, they are sorted by Peter Binsfeld's Classification of Demons.</P>
		<P>The concept first appeared in <A href="/me/work/87.html">87 - An Epilogue</A>, which first was intended to be based completely on the 9 circles concept by Dathe Alighieri. It presented itself as an interepretation of afterlife, the end, which though, lead the beginning of another scenario. The actions were seen in the past and later would form into a timeline. The symbol of hell shows an implication of a stairwell of 10 steps or something similar to the Map of Hell by Botticelli, descending into a cross.</P>

		<P>The purgatory concept is not fully developed. It was first featured in <A href="/me/work/dreath.html">DREATH</A>. The purgatory is a concept of the real world that we live in, the present. It poses the idea of not being judged by someone, but recalling your past actions and judging yourself. Out of this come consequences and the next events happen, as the actions are done. Thereafter forms a conclusion and the final pathway is paved. The symbol of purgatory shows a complex kaleidoscopic octagon figure, possibly replicating the complexity of life itself and our ignorance towards it.</P>

			<P>Praesens</P>
		</DIV>
		<P>The paradise concept was first described in <A href="/me/work/peccataMea.html">Peccata Mea - A Trilogy (Praesens)</A>. GreatCorn's own ideology rejects any concepts of heaven, eternal peace and ascension for himself. He describes the paradise dwellers as blind and fanatical, however, enjoying themselves well in their habitat. As the events are happening in the future, GreatCorn is not a part of it and he doesn't see himself to ever come to the place. Though, it is his final destination, but in which he, unlike the inhabitants shall suffer eternal anathema. The symbol of paradise shows a conjunction, which becomes more complex and uneven, the closer it gets to the center. In it, instead of a final point is an opening into nothingness, the void.</P>
