		<P>Sometimes referred to as GreatCorn's Hell, the 10-Tier Hell or 87 Hell, it shows itself as somewhat of a reinterpretation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The structure combines the 9 circles of hell from Inferno and the 7 deadly sins from Purgatorio. The concept is used in GreatCorn's creations of many types - from music to digital artwork and videogames. GreatCorn also includes small concepts of his own Purgatorio and Paradiso.</P>
		<P>GreatCorn's hell begins similar to Dante's Inferno, except the first circle/tier is Acheron, then comes Limbo. The sixth circle, which according to the Divine Comedy should've been Wrath and Styx, becomes Sloth. Then, the positioning continues through by the 7 Deadly Sins and the 10th tier is Cocytus. Each circle has a theme, its guardian, icon, color, and certain souls, suffering inside. However, that may differ concerning the art form. In some forms, the guardians are not present (e.g. no need, as in sheet music). When they are, they are sorted by Peter Binsfeld's Classification of Demons.</P>
		<P>The concept first appeared in <A href="/me/work/87.html">87 - An Epilogue</A>, which first was intended to be based completely on the 9 circles concept by Dante Alighieri. It presented itself as an interpretation of the afterlife, the end, which though, lead to the beginning of another scenario. The actions were seen in the past and later would form into a timeline. The symbol of hell shows an implication of a stairwell of 10 steps or something similar to the Map of Hell by Botticelli, descending into a cross.</P>

		</DIV>
		<P>The purgatory concept is not fully developed. It was first featured in <A href="/me/work/dreath.html">DREATH</A>. Purgatory is a concept of the real world that we live in, the present. It poses the idea of not being judged by someone, but recalling and contemplating past actions and judging yourself. Out of this come consequences and the next events happen, as the actions are done. Thereafter forms a conclusion and the final pathway is paved. The symbol of purgatory shows a complex kaleidoscopic octagon figure, possibly replicating the complexity of life itself and our ignorance towards it.</P>

			<P>Praesens</P>
		</DIV>
		<P>The paradise concept was first described in <A href="/me/work/peccataMea.html">Peccata Mea - A Trilogy (Praesens)</A>. The narrator's own ideology rejects any concepts of heaven, eternal peace, and ascension for himself. He describes the paradise dwellers as blind and fanatical, however, enjoying themselves well in their habitat. As the events are happening in the future, the narrator is not a part of it and he doesn't see himself ever coming to the place. Though it is his final destination, in which he, unlike the inhabitants shall suffer eternal anathema. The symbol of paradise shows conjunction, which becomes more complex and uneven, the closer it gets to the center. In it, instead of a final point is an opening into nothingness, the void.</P>
