		<HR>
		<P>Kurlykistan is <S>pretty much a fictional world</S> <B>a former nation, now an undercover organisation</B>, first being named the Cyrian Regiments, later Kurlykongard and finally, Kurlykistan in the lore. It was founded by GreatCorn with the help of his friends. The beginnings were split up between videos and time. The first call was on a video from 13.07.2016, <A href="https://youtu.be/7IXdZhpnh7w">Кряканье Bandicam</A> (Cracking Bandicam), where GreatCorn called himself a shrimp. This was due to a song by the band Los Estramboticos, La Cerveza y El Dolor being stuck in his head and the lyrics "mas cerveza", being close in sound to "я креветка" (I'm a shrimp). The second call was in the famous <A href="https://youtu.be/x0qyuJbPQk0">МИНУТКА РОБЛОКСА</A>, where GreatCorn called himself a pancake repeatedly by accident ("я, блин", in which "блин" could be translated as both "pancake" and "damn"). The last one was on a Roblox stream with <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A> and <A href="/me/friends/ragy.html">Ragy</A>, where the guys were playing Before the Dawn in Roblox and due to sitting on a branch, GreatCorn repeatedly said that he's a sparrow. After these events, his friends (most notable, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A>) began calling him Vorobushek Blin Krevetovich (literally Sparrow Pancake Shrimp). This happened at the end of 2017.</P>

The symbol, uniting a sparrow, a pancake, a shrimp and a corn on the cob was later used as the symbol of the Cyrian religion, Åotir Mundý. GreatCorn later makes the Kurlykistanian flag, the Kurlykistan Skype group and profile pictures for his friends.</P>

		<P>After some time, there is a Viber group created and GreatCorn begins to label his work with Kurlykistanian Alliance. He starts posting pictures of some Kurlykistanian events. <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A> forms his own world with the Tomatoland airship. Later GreatCorn writes a short story of how Kurlykistan was a secret alliance that helped the Third Reich in World War 2, later to form as an independent nation, but fall after the Great Kurlykistanian Battle with Tomatoland, the loss of the Third Reich in the war and the arrival of the Red Army. He writes about Mivina, a common in Ukraine 5-minute-foods and spices brand, which is actually a plant that has strong healing powers. <A href="/me/friends/lightningMivina.html">LIGHTNINGMIVINA</A> and his brother help introduce the Kurlykistanian currency, kurlyk (курлык), ⓚ.

		<H2>Lore</H2>
		<HR>
		<P>The history of Kurlykistan is now divided into eight periods:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><B>The Period of Old Beginnings</B> (up to the VIII century AD). The exact beginning of this period is unknown. It did not have such a thing as Kurlykistan, or even Kurlykongard. The Cyrian race existed, but did not have large-scale associations. There were small "councils", the largest of which contained up to thirty Cyrians. They were scattered all over the world, the languages ​​of different peoples mixed and smoothly made the beginnings of the language, later known as Khbvryliss (Kurlykongard meraia), but for the most part Latin and Scandinavian roots dominated.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>Period of the Four Brotherhoods</B> (VIII - XI century). According to the Old Kurlykongard religion of the four worlds (Åotir Mundý), four large-scale brotherhoods based on the four Cröa settled, giving the previously anarchic and weak Cyrian people strength and control. The Cyrian Regiments appear, the lands that the Brotherhoods own and give the Cyrians a place to live and freedom of life. The regiments did not have exact names, they were formed among the people and later became the names of the cities of Kurlykongard.
			<BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Aötor - the Cröa of the upper world, was located in the northern parts of the Cyrian reigns and looked more like a closed society, trying to contact less with the other brotherhoods and, thereby, isolating itself in the mountains and considering themselves descendants of the Cröa. There, they created a closed council to rule over the Cyrians under the mountains. Because of this, not much is known about the Ayotor brotherhood.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Törlagg - the Cröa of our civilized world, ruled the central, western and northeastern parts of the Regiments. It drew up councils for solving questions about people, agriculture, collective farm, etc. This brotherhood ruled over most of the Cyrian people, it was with it that Khbvryliss was built, but in rewriting the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Aötor Brotherhood appropriated it.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Sýlv, the Cröa of our wild world, was located in the forests of the central-eastern parts of the Regiments. Like the Brotherhood of Aötor, the Brotherhood of Sýlv was like a closed society, although in this case, a tribe. While the members of the Aötor Brotherhood were presented as superior, sophisticated individuals, the members of the Sýlv Brotherhood were wild Cyrians who had left civilization. Because of this, in some sources about the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Sýlv Brotherhood was called a tribe.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Neqaötor - the Cröa of the lower world, ruled the southern parts. This brotherhood, just like the Brotherhood of Aötor, considered itself the descendants of the Cröa, but instead of isolating itself from the people and not personally intruding into their lives, it featured dictatorship, chauvinism, and discrimination of certain subspecies. In the 10th century, slave trade began to flourish.
			 <BR>
			Closer to the IX-X centuries, the Khbvryliss language was formed.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Kurlykongard Period</B> (XI - XIV century). During this period the Cyrian Regiments were founded into a separate, independent state. The first Cyrian alliance is cited and later Kurlykongard founded as a nation by Genegorn the Lion Sphincter. The Brotherhoods unite and form one domain, although still divided into four parts, but acting in one council. The slave trade is punishable by law after the Cyrian Rights are written out. Separate cities and settlements were formed. Kurlykongard becomes an empire under the rule of the Gard family. Around the end of the XIII century, the southern parts of Kurlykongard were invaded by the reign of the subjimers under the leadership of Tomataar Tukarvestnik the Elder. After that, religion also changes significantly: worshipping of the Cröa changes by worshipping of the four worlds themselves. Birds from the genus of true sparrows (Passer) are considered sacred, as representatives of the upper world, and their desecration is despised by the Kurlykongard Occluse. Desecration of crustaceans from the genus of real shrimp (Caridea), representatives of the lower world, is also despised. The ideologies of the Brotherhoods of Törlagg and Sýlv (mainly Törlagg) are moving out in front and the Cyrians under the government cease (at least openly) to refer themselves to the Cröa.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of the Fall of Gard or the Great Silence</B> (XIV - XIX century). After the Great Kurlykongard War and the extermination of the entire Gard family, Kurlykongard is disintegrated as an empire and soon as a nation. It exists in isolation from the environment and again in separate alliances that work only for their own good and do not invade the interests of others. It is believed that Kurlykongard is dying out, but in fact it continues to exist in a silence. Smoothly Kurlykongard changes to Kurlykistan and under the influence of the surrounding world, the Kurlykistanian language is created, spreading mostly in the southern and eastern regions. There are Ъ (clean, later Vialeny Pirog) and Ь (clean, later Tvorozhnoje Miaso) and dialects: ÖЪ (Blyat), Å (Schwedishe), ЪЬ (Zarena Kaczelja), ÖЬ (Blyachi Pruzhinski), etc.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of Rebirth</B> (XIX century - 1936). In this period and beyond, the main idea of ​​Kurlykistan is rebirth, that is, again founding as a nation. Gradually, small alliances are formed into larger ones. Cooperative communities are formed with Nekoland at the head of <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Feldwebel Voron Shnurok (later Jewish Cat)</A>.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The period of the Alliance</B> (1936 - 1943). The Kurlykistan Alliance's Auxiliary Forces of the Third Reich (KAAFTR or further simply the Alliance) is being formed, taking part in many secret special operations of the Third Reich (Sea Lion, Weserubung, etc.).</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of Kurlykistan</B> (1943 - 1945). The shortest period of Kurlykistan, because of this, sometimes refers to the previous period. Commander-in-chief Vorobushek Blin succeeds in founding Kurlykistan as a nation and achieving the goal of Rebirth - to re-create Kurlykongard in the present times. Kurlykistan is again independent and although it exists officially, it is isolated from the outside world (xenophobia). Interrupted by the attack of Tomatoland, the Great Battle of Kurlykistan and further by the advance of the Red Army on Berlin and neighboring territories.</LI>
			<LI><B>The Period of the Second Silence</B> (1945 - present). Kurlykistan again goes into a silence after a somewhat unsuccessful rebirth and unites with Tomatoland. It exists as an underground organization with headquarters in the shelter (and possibly unidentified societies outside), codenamed "Ovoschnaya Telezhka". The Kurlykistan movement is promoted by <A href="/me/friends/rey.html">Rey Ogurets</A>, like the Commander-in-Chief Vorobushek, but more closed. There are plans to establish the United Kurlykistan Nation, but they are not yet feasible.</LI>

	<H2>Åotir Mundý</H2>
	<HR>
	<P>According to the Cyrian religion, life is divided into four worlds. The upper world, symbolizing the highness, the sky, the ether; our two, middle worlds -  one symbolizing our civilization and development as a separate nation, the other - the wild earthly nature, the earth; and the last, lower world, symbolizing the nether dark dungeons where evil lurks, and where do those who have done evil go after death. The four worlds exist in harmony, where without one there would be no other. In the Kurlykongard Okklus, this concept was used in the same way as it is now, but in a slightly different direction. From a historical point of view, it is not known where the Cyrian race came from, there are various hypotheses and theories, both scientific and religious.</P>
	
	<P>"And the land was free, but there was no rest on it. Chaos and incoherence reigned over the earth, and the earth suffered from that. Then, four brothers were born. The sun's rays weaved the first brother, Aötor, and he sat down on the throne in order to reign over the heavens and the highest and give peace to those who left this land, anyhow to be reborn in the future. A second brother, Neqaötor, came out of the waves, and sat on the underground throne, where he ruled evil and punished those who left this earth with a vicious soul. The rustle of grass and foliage of trees weaved the third brother, Sýlv, he came out of a pine in order to rule nature and the living and give fruit to the hungry and in need. And three brothers gathered together and created the fourth, Törlagg. And there was in him a free bird from the upper world, and there was justice in him from the lower world, and there was in him the strength and power of the earth. And the fourth brother got up and created his own kind, anyhow to rule over them. And where Aötor walked, the morning reigned, and where Neqaötor walked, night reigned there. Where Sýlv walked, greenery grew and trees bloomed. And where Törlagg walked, its own Cyrian life advanced."</P>
	
	<P>According to the Cyrian religion, the four Cröa created the Cyrian race. They were in agreement and harmony, and each ruled their own world. The four worlds were interconnected with each other, and this concept formed the Ring of Concord, which is the symbol of the Cyrian religion. The four points are completely connected to each other and enclosed in a circle. The symbol was often used in the Kurlykongard Okklus and further in the Kurlykistan national emblem and flag. There is also the concept of heaven and hell in the Cyrian religion, but they believe in rebirth, even after falling into the lower world. Cyrians believe in a system of accumulating good and evil deeds and later revenge on the evil soul.</P>
	
	<P>"And the stork went out and said his word, that Aötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
	- Ayotor told me about good deeds and about the need to accomplish them, for when a soul leaves the life of ours, judgment will befall and determine who is worthy of the highest, and who is obliged to suffer for the evil they have done. And I will name before you 8 decrees about good:<BR>
	<OL>
		<LI>Grant mutual understanding to your neighbor and friend, and guide him on the right path.</LI>
		<LI>Understand your friend that have done evil against you or others, but forgive him, for he did not know what he was doing.</LI>
		<LI>Show concern not only for yourself, but also for your friend, do not lower the value of yourself and your own kind.</LI>
		<LI>Be ready to help your neighbor and your friend at any moment.</LI>
		<LI>Find an opposite friend and grant them as much happiness as only Aötor himself can bestow, and may a new soul come into this world.</LI>
		<LI>Be able to accept another who is not like you and judge the essence by his soul, and not by his appearance.</LI>
		<LI>Grant life not only to your own kind, but also to the surrounding nature, and its gifts will befall you.</LI>
		<LI>Honor the Cröa of the highest, and they will bless you with their gifts.</LI>
	</OL>
	
	And the stork finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it. And the ostrich came out and said his word, that Neqaötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
	- Nekyotor spoke to me, but about the deeds of evil, and about the need to bypass them, for during the trial between the worlds when there are more deeds of these than good intentions, we will be punished cruelly by the boiling underground sea and we will be in torment there until we atone for all the guilt of ours. And I will name before you 8 decrees about evil:<BR>
	<OL>
		<LI>Do not defile another, neither with an evil deed, nor a bad word, nor a mighty blow.</LI>
		<LI>Do not defile the thought of one behind his back in front of others.</LI>
		<LI>Do not steal from another neither the golden kurlyk nor the good glory.</LI>
		<LI>Do not skimp on others that are in need and request.</LI>
		<LI>Do not hold evil about another, for all this evil will return to you.</LI>
		<LI>Do not defile your environment and nature, for you will live in it.</LI>
		<LI>Do not be prideful of yourself, and do not put yourself above the Cröa of the highest.</LI>
		<LI>Do not ask the Cröa for an evil gift in order to defile your neighbor or your friend.</LI>
	</OL>
	
	And the ostrich finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it.</P>
	<P>The Cyrian religion is free; they do not have to constantly and regularly pray to the Cröa. The Cyrians believed more in good relationships between each other and in helping nature.</P>
