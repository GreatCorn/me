		<P>Kurlykistan is <S>pretty much a fictional world</S> <B>a former nation, now an undercover organization</B>, first being named the Cyrian Regiments, later Kurlykongard, and finally, Kurlykistan in the lore. It was founded by GreatCorn with the help of his friends. The beginnings were split up between videos and time. The first call was on a video from 13.07.2016, <A href="https://youtu.be/7IXdZhpnh7w">Кряканье Bandicam</A> (Cracking Bandicam), where GreatCorn called himself a shrimp. This was due to a song by the band Los Estramboticos, La Cerveza y El Dolor being stuck in his head and the lyrics "mas cerveza", being close in sound to "я креветка" (I'm a shrimp). The second call was in the famous <A href="https://youtu.be/x0qyuJbPQk0">МИНУТКА РОБЛОКСА</A>, where GreatCorn called himself a pancake repeatedly by accident ("я, блин", in which "блин" could be translated as both "pancake" and "damn"). The last one was on a Roblox stream with <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A> and <A href="/me/friends/ragy.html">Ragy</A>, where the guys were playing Before the Dawn in Roblox and due to sitting on a branch, GreatCorn repeatedly said that he's a sparrow. After these events, his friends (most notable, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A>) began calling him Vorobushek Blin Krevetovich (literally Sparrow Pancake Shrimp). This happened at the end of 2017.</P>

The symbol, uniting a sparrow, a pancake, a shrimp, and an ear of corn on the cob was later used as the symbol of the Cyrian religion, Åotir Mundý. GreatCorn later makes the Kurlykistanian flag, the Kurlykistan Skype group, and profile pictures for his friends.</P>

		<P>After some time, there is a Viber group created and GreatCorn begins to label his work with Kurlykistanian Alliance. He starts posting pictures of some Kurlykistanian events. <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A> forms his own world with the Tomatoland airship. Later GreatCorn writes a short story of how Kurlykistan was a secret alliance that helped the Third Reich in World War 2, later to form as an independent nation, but fll after the Great Kurlykistanian Battle with Tomatoland, the loss of the Third Reich in the war and the arrival of the Red Army. He writes about Mivina, a common in Ukraine 5-minute-foods and spices brand, which is actually a plant that has strong healing powers. <A href="/me/friends/lightningMivina.html">LIGHTNINGMIVINA</A> and his brother help introduce the Kurlykistanian currency, kurlyk (курлык), ⓚ. GreatCorn tries to incorporate everything into a fiction novel, but fails.</P>
		<P>At the end of March 2019 <A href="/me/friends/basya.html">Basya</A> temporarily took rule over Kurlykistan after GreatCorn's short disappearance.

In the end, GreatCorn got most of the votes and went as the president of Kurlykistan.

		<HR>
		<P>The history of Kurlykistan is now divided into eight periods:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><B>The Period of Old Beginnings</B> (up to the VIII century AD). The exact beginning of this period is unknown. It did not have such a thing as Kurlykistan, or even Kurlykongard. The Cyrian race existed, but did not have large-scale associations. There were small "councils", the largest of which contained up to thirty Cyrians. They were scattered all over the world, the languages ​​of different peoples mixed and smoothly made the beginnings of the language, later known as Khbvryliss (Kurlykongard meraia), but for the most part Latin and Scandinavian roots dominated.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>Period of the Four Brotherhoods</B> (VIII - XI century). According to the Old Kurlykongard religion of the four worlds (Åotir Mundý), four large-scale brotherhoods based on the four Cröa settled, giving the previously anarchic and weak Cyrian people strength and control. The Cyrian Regiments appear, the lands that the Brotherhoods own and give the Cyrians a place to live and freedom of life. The regiments did not have exact names, they were formed among the people and later became the names of the cities of Kurlykongard.
			<BR>
			  <IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" width=32>The Brotherhood of Aötor - the Cröa of the upper world, was located in the northern parts of the Cyrian reigns and looked more like a closed society, trying to contact less with the other brotherhoods and, thereby, isolating itself in the mountains and considering themselves descendants of the Cröa. There, they created a closed council to rule over the Cyrians under the mountains. Because of this, not much is known about the Ayotor brotherhood.
			 <BR>
			  <IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(90deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Törlagg - the Cröa of our civilized world, ruled the central, western and northeastern parts of the Regiments. It drew up councils for solving questions about people, agriculture, collective farm, etc. This brotherhood ruled over most of the Cyrian people, it was with it that Khbvryliss was built, but in rewriting the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Aötor Brotherhood appropriated it.
			 <BR>
			  <IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(270deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Sýlv, the Cröa of our wild world, was located in the forests of the central-eastern parts of the Regiments. Like the Brotherhood of Aötor, the Brotherhood of Sýlv was like a closed society, although in this case, a tribe. While the members of the Aötor Brotherhood were presented as superior, sophisticated individuals, the members of the Sýlv Brotherhood were wild Cyrians who had left civilization. Because of this, in some sources about the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Sýlv Brotherhood was called a tribe.
			 <BR>
			  <IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(180deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Neqaötor - the Cröa of the lower world, ruled the southern parts. This brotherhood, just like the Brotherhood of Aötor, considered itself the descendants of the Cröa, but instead of isolating itself from the people and not personally intruding into their lives, it featured dictatorship, chauvinism, and discrimination of certain subspecies. In the 10th century, slave trade began to flourish.
			<BR>
			Closer to the IX-X centuries, the Khbvryliss language was formed.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Kurlykongard Period</B> (XI - XIV century). During this period the Cyrian Regiments were founded into a separate, independent state. The first Cyrian alliance is cited and later Kurlykongard founded as a nation by Genegorn the Lion Sphincter. The Brotherhoods unite and form one domain, although still divided into four parts, but acting in one council. The slave trade is punishable by law after the Cyrian Rights are written out. Separate cities and settlements were formed. Kurlykongard becomes an empire under the rule of the Gard family. Around the end of the XIII century, the southern parts of Kurlykongard were invaded by the reign of the subjimeres under the leadership of Tomataar Tukarvestnik the Elder. After that, religion also changes significantly: worshipping of the Cröa changes by worshipping of the four worlds themselves. Birds from the genus of true sparrows (Passer) are considered sacred, as representatives of the upper world, and their desecration is despised by the Kurlykongard Occluse. Desecration of crustaceans from the genus of real shrimp (Caridea), representatives of the lower world, is also despised. The ideologies of the Brotherhoods of Törlagg and Sýlv (mainly Törlagg) are moving out in front and the Cyrians under the government cease (at least openly) to refer themselves to the Cröa.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of the Fall of Gard or the Great Silence</B> (XIV - XIX century). After the Great Kurlykongard War and the extermination of the entire Gard family, Kurlykongard is disintegrated as an empire and soon as a nation. It exists in isolation from the environment and again in separate alliances that work only for their own good and do not invade the interests of others. It is believed that Kurlykongard is dying out, but in fact it continues to exist in a silence. Smoothly Kurlykongard changes to Kurlykistan and under the influence of the surrounding world, the Kurlykistanian language is created, spreading mostly in the southern and eastern regions. There are Ъ (pure, later Vyalenyy Pirog) and Ь (pure, later Tvorozhnoye Myaso) and dialects: ÖЪ (Blyat), Å (Schwedishe), ЪЬ (Zarena Kaczelja), ÖЬ (Blyachi Pruzhinski), etc.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of Rebirth</B> (XIX century - 1936). In this period and beyond, the main idea of ​​Kurlykistan is rebirth, that is, again founding as a nation. Gradually, small alliances are formed into larger ones. Cooperative communities are formed with Nekoland at the head of <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Feldwebel Voron Shnurok (later Jewish Cat)</A>.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The period of the Alliance</B> (1936 - 1943). The Kurlykistan Alliance's Auxiliary Forces of the Third Reich (KAAFTR or further simply the Alliance) is being formed, taking part in many secret special operations of the Third Reich (Sea Lion, Weserubung, etc.).</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of Kurlykistan</B> (1943 - 1945). The shortest period of Kurlykistan, because of this, sometimes refers to the previous period. Commander-in-chief Vorobushek Blin succeeds in founding Kurlykistan as a nation and achieving the goal of Rebirth - to re-create Kurlykongard in the present times. Kurlykistan is again independent and although it exists officially, it is isolated from the outside world (xenophobia). Interrupted by the attack of Tomatoland, the Great Battle of Kurlykistan and further by the advance of the Red Army on Berlin and neighboring territories.</LI>
			
			<LI><B>The Period of the Second Silence</B> (1945 - 2021). Kurlykistan again goes into a silence after a somewhat unsuccessful rebirth and unites with Tomatoland. It exists as an underground organization with headquarters in the shelter (and possibly unidentified societies outside), codenamed "Ovoschnaya Telezhka". The Kurlykistan movement is promoted by <A href="/me/friends/rey.html">Rey Ogurets</A>, like the Commander-in-Chief Vorobushek, but more closed. There are plans to establish the United Kurlykistan Nation, but they are not yet feasible.</LI>
	</UL>
	<H2 id=Religion>Åotir Mundý</H2>
	<HR>
	<P>According to the Cyrian religion, life is divided into four worlds. The upper world, symbolizing the highness, the sky, the ether; our two, middle worlds -  one symbolizing our civilization and development as a separate nation, the other - the wild earthly nature, the earth; and the last, lower world, symbolizing the nether dark dungeons where evil lurks, and where do those who have done evil go after death. The four worlds exist in harmony, where without one there would be no other. In the Kurlykongard Okklus, this concept was used in the same way as it is now, but in a slightly different direction. From a historical point of view, it is not known where the Cyrian race came from, there are various hypotheses and theories, both scientific and religious.</P>
	
	<P>"And the land was free, but there was no rest on it. Chaos and incoherence reigned over the earth, and the earth suffered from that. Then, four brothers were born. The sun's rays weaved the first brother, Aötor, and he sat down on the throne in order to reign over the heavens and the highest and give peace to those who left this land, anyhow to be reborn in the future. A second brother, Neqaötor, came out of the waves and sat on the underground throne, where he ruled evil and punished those who left this earth with a vicious soul. The rustle of grass and foliage weaved the third brother, Sýlv, who came out of a pine tree in order to rule nature and the living and give fruit to the hungry and in need. And three brothers gathered together and created the fourth, Törlagg. And there was in him a free bird from the upper world, and there was justice in him from the lower world, and there was in him the strength and power of the earth. And the fourth brother got up and created his own kind, anyhow to rule over them. And where Aötor walked, the morning reigned, and where Neqaötor walked, night reigned there. Where Sýlv walked, greenery grew and trees bloomed. And where Törlagg walked, its own Cyrian life advanced."</P>
	
	<P>According to the Cyrian religion, the four Cröa created the Cyrian race. They were in agreement and harmony, and each ruled their own world. The four worlds were interconnected with each other, and this concept formed the Ring of Concord, which is the symbol of the Cyrian religion. The four points are completely connected to each other and enclosed in a circle. The symbol was often used in the Kurlykongard Okklus and further in the Kurlykistan national emblem and flag. There is also the concept of heaven and hell in the Cyrian religion, but they believe in rebirth, even after falling into the lower world. Cyrians believe in a system of accumulating good and evil deeds and later revenge on the evil soul.</P>
	
	<P>"And the stork went out and said his word, that Aötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
	- Ayotor told me about good deeds and about the need to accomplish them, for when a soul leaves the life of ours, judgment will befall and determine who is worthy of the highest, and who is obliged to suffer for the evil they have done. And I will name before you 8 decrees about good:<BR>
	<OL>
		<LI>Grant mutual understanding to your neighbor and friend, and guide him on the right path.</LI>
		<LI>Understand your friend that has done evil against you or others, but forgive him, for he did not know what he was doing.</LI>
		<LI>Show concern not only for yourself but also for your friend, do not lower the value of yourself and your own kind.</LI>
		<LI>Be ready to help your neighbor and your friend at any moment.</LI>
		<LI>Find an opposite friend and grant them as much happiness as only Aötor himself can bestow, and may a new soul come into this world.</LI>
		<LI>Be able to accept another who is not like you and judge the essence by his soul, and not by his appearance.</LI>
		<LI>Grant life not only to your own kind, but also to the surrounding nature, and its gifts will befall you.</LI>
		<LI>Honor the Cröa of the highest, and they will bless you with their gifts.</LI>
	</OL>
	
	And the stork finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it. And the ostrich came out and said his word, that Neqaötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
	- Nekyotor spoke to me, but about the deeds of evil, and about the need to bypass them, for during the trial between the worlds when there are more deeds of these than good intentions, we will be punished cruelly by the boiling underground sea and we will be in torment there until we atone for all the guilt of ours. And I will name before you 8 decrees about evil:<BR>
	<OL>
		<LI>Do not defile another, neither with an evil deed, nor a bad word, nor a mighty blow.</LI>
		<LI>Do not defile the thought of one behind his back in front of others.</LI>
		<LI>Do not steal from another neither a golden kurlyk nor the good glory.</LI>
		<LI>Do not skimp on others that are in need and request.</LI>
		<LI>Do not hold evil about another, for all this evil will return to you.</LI>
		<LI>Do not defile your environment and nature, for you will live in it.</LI>
		<LI>Do not be prideful of yourself, and do not put yourself above the Cröa of the highest.</LI>
		<LI>Do not ask the Cröa for an evil gift in order to defile your neighbor or your friend.</LI>
	</OL>
	
	And the ostrich finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it.</P>
	<P>The Cyrian religion is free; they do not have to constantly and regularly pray to the Cröa. The Cyrians believed more in good relationships between each other and in helping nature.</P>
	
	<H2 id=Language>Kurlykistanian language (курлыкистаненъ буглек)</H2>
	<P>The Kurlykistanian language is slowly being created mostly by GreatCorn with the help of his friends. In nature, it is most similar to Russian or Bulgarian. Here are some, but not all details about it.</P>
	<P><B>Sample phrases:</B> Какво псевав зово? <I>(What is your name?)</I> Тсевївöъ штрубля адрастны! <I>(I'm feeling/my things are good/lucky!)</I> Сепсец нанты. <I>(Good/calm night.)</I>Съи мьолїцъ шнажыла шутяйничїтъ. <I>(These old men are joking.)</I></P>
	<P>The alphabet consists of mostly Russian letters with their own names, though some additions are made.</P>

	</TABLE>
	<P>As with Russian, all nouns have genders and conjunct adjectives and verbs need to be modified to fit that. <B>Ъъ</B> <I>(vyalenyy pirog)</I> is used to represent masculinity, <B>Ьь</B> <I>(tvorozhnoye myaso)</I> is used to represent femininity and an abscense of any of the two represents neutral. In such example: <B>"адрастен дюбюффе, адрастенъ вейр, адрастень нанта"</B> <I>(good morning, good day, good night)</I>, the word "адрастен" is an adjective, connected to the next word after it. <B>"Дюбюффе"</B> is neutral, <B>"вейр"</B> is masculine and <B>"нанта"</B> is feminine. The gender letters are added at the end of the word's base. In noun declension the gender letters dissappear: e.g. <B>"адрастной нанты"</B> <I>(have a good night)</I>.</P>
	<P>To indicate plural adjectives, the letter <B>Її</B> <I>(yidur)</I> is used to replace the last vowel. Such as: <B>"изберклїмöъ людцы"</B> <I>(popular people)</I>. Note the use of the letter <B>ÖЪöъ</B> <I>(blyat)</I>, which indicates unconfirmed gender, as unlike Russian, plural adjectives and verbs use genders as well. <B>ÖЪöъ</B> is not used when writing, only in dictionaries and translators.</P>
	<P>Verbs follow mostly the same formula as adjectives. To denote the gender, the word's base is taken and a gender letter is added at the end. To denote plural form, the last vowel is replaced with <B>Її</B>. Such as: <B>"öъґи ромблїтöъ"</B> <I>(they do/make)</I> (notice the pronouns use gender letters as a prefix, rather than an ending).</P>
	<P>While most of the grammar is similar to Russian, a new form of verbs is added: incentive-action form. In such form, a verb expresses what action the associated object is incented to do. E.g. "сье шутяйка аза орняичить" (this joke makes me laugh). It is used by adding the suffix "-чи-" before the ending consonant.</P>
	
	<H2 id=SV>SV (Sancta Vita)</H2>
	<P><IMG class=Picture src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanSV.png" width=128 style="float: left">In Kurlykistan lore, SV (Sancta Vita (lat. Sacred Life) is a secret cult with assumed to be malicious intents, committing illegal political actions inside and outside Kurlykistan. Little is known about it, but they are told to be worshipping life and the pleasure given by it (often sexual), hedonism, rejecting Åotir Mundý. Many organizations' headquarters were revealed on the outskirts and borders of Kurlykistan and a couple inside. Some political agents were suspected to be members of SV, but only Oroleg Liotchek, mayor of Mivinuvo (Мивинъво) (1944-1945) was confirmed to be one. The cult's first mentions lead back to ca. 1870.</P>
	<P>In Kurlykistan-Tomatoland lore, the cult worships its own pantheon, called "Stomotodika", some of the deities are described here:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><B>Shnurpshyk</B> – an incomprehensible, possibly omnipotent entity. The motives of it are unknown and are feared of, alike to its visual appearance, though the only fact known about it is that its height "in ordinary conditions" is ~30cm (1′). Said to appear mostly in dreams, but its representation may be present in the real world, unknown to anyone.</LI>
		<LI><B>Bugyl</B> – an omnipresent entity. Assumed to be large, yet no approximated measurements are specified. It is said to produce a low-frequency, gurgling sound, but as no one has documented it nor the witnessing of the Bugyl, it is unknown exactly, how the sound can be produced. Described to be less powerful, than Shnurpshyk.</LI>
		<LI><B>Kolob</B> – an entity that is said to take a child's fate into its hands after one invites it into their home. The way fate will turn is unknown. No descriptions of its motives nor visual appearances exist.</LI>
		<LI><B>Webubychko</B> – a lurking entity that is said to await us at every corner, yet we never come in contact with it. The moment Webubychko reveals itself is when a person meets their death. To "release Webubychko" is to return back to life with the awareness of death as its end and to continue getting the most enjoyment out of it.</LI>
		<LI><B>Khoojekhbyh</B> – an incomprehensible entity, said to be the representation of madness, insanity. Those, who witness it lose their mind. The only close to coherent descriptions of its visual appearance, given by the mentally unstable are: "as big as a college meeting" and "arms like legs, but all of them".</LI>
		<LI><B>Biskalele</B> – said to be the sun itself, as a sentient entity.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>The exact ways these are worshipped are unknown, as there are no documented records of SV meetings and ceremonies.</P>
	
	<H2 id=Tomatoland>Tomatoland</H2>
	<HR>
	<P>In the Kurlykistan lore, a rivaling nation, home for the subjimere race. Later, by the will of the <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A>, a giant futuristic airship. I don't know, he didn't send me any stuff or info about Tomatoland, I know it's rude to elicit information, but I asked three or more times. I mean, I don't really want to obtrude or something, but I just wanted to document the Tomatoland. <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Tomato</A>'s a nice guy and smart too, he told me quite a bit about the sci-fi stuff in Tomatoland, like when they found another livable planet and tried to transport their supplies there through an unstable wormhole, or how there were many different parallel universes; but due to my crappy memory I didn't remember anything. Yeah, I'm sorry, just don't know what to put here really.</P>
