		<HR>
		<P>Kurlykistan is pretty much a fictional world, first being named the Cyrian Regiments, later Kurlykongard and finally, Kurlykistan in the lore. It was founded by GreatCorn with the help of his friends. The beginnings were split up between videos and time. The first call was on a video from 13.07.2016, <A href="https://youtu.be/7IXdZhpnh7w">Кряканье Bandicam</A> (Cracking Bandicam), where GreatCorn called himself a shrimp. This was due to a song by the band Los Estramboticos, La Cerveza y El Dolor being stuck in his head and the lyrics "mas cerveza", being close in sound to "я креветка" (I'm a shrimp). The second call was in the famous <A href="https://youtu.be/x0qyuJbPQk0">МИНУТКА РОБЛОКСА</A>, where GreatCorn called himself a pancake repeatedly by accident ("я, блин", in which "блин" could be translated as both "pancake" and "damn"). The last one was on a Roblox stream with <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Misha</A>, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A> and <A href="/me/friends/ragy.html">Ragy</A>, where the guys were playing Before the Dawn in Roblox and due to sitting on a branch, GreatCorn repeatedly said that he's a sparrow. After these events, his friends (most notable, <A href="/me/friends/rroziew.html">Rroziew</A>) began calling him Vorobushek Blin Krevetovich (literally Sparrow Pancake Shrimp). This happened at the end of 2017.</P>

The symbol, uniting a sparrow, a pancake, a shrimp and a corn on the cob was later used as the symbol of the Cyrian religion, Åotir Mundý. GreatCorn later makes the Kurlykistanian flag, the Kurlykistan Skype group and profile pictures for his friends.</P>

		<P>After some time, there is a Viber group created and GreatCorn begins to label his work with Kurlykistanian Alliance. He starts posting pictures of some Kurlykistanian events. <A href="/me/work/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A> forms his own world with the Tomatoland airship. Later he writes a short story of how Kurlykistan was a secret alliance that helped the Third Reich in World War 2, later to form as an independent nation, but fall after the Great Kurlykistanian Battle with Tomatoland, the loss of the Third Reich in the war and the arrival of the Red Army. He writes about Mivina, a common in Ukraine 5-minute-foods and spices brand, which is actually a plant that has strong healing powers. <A href="/me/work/lightningMivina.html">LIGHTNINGMIVINA</A> and his brother help introduce the Kurlykistanian currency, kurlyk (курлык), ⓚ. GreatCorn tries to incorporate everything into a fiction novel, but fails. Many inside jokes get incorporated into the lore and then, in 2020, GreatCorn decides to start writing a proper history book about Kurlykistan.</P>

		<H2>Lore</H2>
		<HR>
		<P>The history of Kurlykistan is now divided into eight periods:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>1. <B>The Period of Old Beginnings</B> (up to the VIII century AD). The exact beginning of this period is unknown. It did not have such a thing as Kurlykistan, or even Kurlykongard. The Cyrian race existed, but did not have large-scale associations. There were small "councils", the largest of which contained up to thirty Cyrians. They were scattered all over the world, the languages ​​of different peoples mixed and smoothly made the beginnings of the language, later known as Khbvryliss (Kurlykongard meraia), but for the most part Latin and Scandinavian roots dominated.</LI>
			
			<LI>2. <B>Period of the Four Brotherhoods</B> (VIII - XI century). According to the Old Kurlykongard religion of the four worlds (Åotir Mundý), four large-scale brotherhoods based on the four Cröa settled, giving the previously anarchic and weak Cyrian people strength and control. The Cyrian Regiments appear, the lands that the Brotherhoods own and give the Cyrians a place to live and freedom of life. The regiments did not have exact names, they were formed among the people and later became the names of the cities of Kurlykongard.
			<BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Aötor - the Cröa of the upper world, was located in the northern parts of the Cyrian reigns and looked more like a closed society, trying to contact less with the other brotherhoods and, thereby, isolating itself in the mountains and considering themselves descendants of the Cröa. There, they created a closed council to rule over the Cyrians under the mountains. Because of this, not much is known about the Ayotor brotherhood.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Törlagg - the Cröa of our civilized world, ruled the central, western and northeastern parts of the Regiments. It drew up councils for solving questions about people, agriculture, collective farm, etc. This brotherhood ruled over most of the Cyrian people, it was with it that Khbvryliss was built, but in rewriting the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Aötor Brotherhood appropriated it.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Sýlv, the Cröa of our wild world, was located in the forests of the central-eastern parts of the Regiments. Like the Brotherhood of Aötor, the Brotherhood of Sýlv was like a closed society, although in this case, a tribe. While the members of the Aötor Brotherhood were presented as superior, sophisticated individuals, the members of the Sýlv Brotherhood were wild Cyrians who had left civilization. Because of this, in some sources about the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Sýlv Brotherhood was called a tribe.
			 <BR>
			  The Brotherhood of Neqaötor - the Cröa of the lower world, ruled the southern parts. This brotherhood, just like the Brotherhood of Aötor, considered itself the descendants of the Cröa, but instead of isolating itself from the people and not personally intruding into their lives, it featured dictatorship, chauvinism, and discrimination of certain subspecies. In the 10th century, slave trade began to flourish.
			 <BR>
			Closer to the IX-X centuries, the Khbvryliss language was formed.</LI>
			
			<LI>3. <B>The Kurlykongard Period</B> (XI - XIV century). During this period the Cyrian Regiments were founded into a separate, independent state. The first Cyrian alliance is cited and later Kurlykongard founded as a nation by Genegorn the Lion Sphincter. The Brotherhoods unite and form one domain, although still divided into four parts, but acting in one council. The slave trade is punishable by law after the Cyrian Rights are written out. Separate cities and settlements were formed. Kurlykongard becomes an empire under the rule of the Gard family. Around the end of the XIII century, the southern parts of Kurlykongard were invaded by the reign of the subjimers under the leadership of Tomataar Tukarvestnik the Elder. After that, religion also changes significantly: worshipping of the Cröa changes by worshipping of the four worlds themselves. Birds from the genus of true sparrows (Passer) are considered sacred, as representatives of the upper world, and their desecration is despised by the Kurlykongard Occluse. Desecration of crustaceans from the genus of real shrimp (Caridea), representatives of the lower world, is also despised. The ideologies of the Brotherhoods of Törlagg and Sýlv (mainly Törlagg) are moving out in front and the Cyrians under the government cease (at least openly) to refer themselves to the Cröa.</LI>
			
			<LI>4. <B>The Period of the Fall of Gard or the Great Silence</B> (XIV - XIX century). After the Great Kurlykongard War and the extermination of the entire Gard family, Kurlykongard is disintegrated as an empire and soon as a nation. It exists in isolation from the environment and again in separate alliances that work only for their own good and do not invade the interests of others. It is believed that Kurlykongard is dying out, but in fact it continues to exist in a silence. Smoothly Kurlykongard changes to Kurlykistan and under the influence of the surrounding world, the Kurlykistanian language is created, spreading mostly in the southern and eastern regions. There are Ъ (clean, later Vialeny Pirog) and Ь (clean, later Tvorozhnoje Miaso) and dialects: ÖЪ (Blyat), Å (Schwedishe), ЪЬ (Zarena Kaczelja), ÖЬ (Blyachi Pruzhinski), etc.</LI>
			
			<LI>5. <B>The Period of Rebirth</B> (XIX century - 1936). In this period and beyond, the main idea of ​​Kurlykistan is rebirth, that is, again founding as a nation. Gradually, small alliances are formed into larger ones. Cooperative communities are formed with Nekoland at the head of Feldwebel Voron Shnurok (later Jewish Cat).</LI>
			
			<LI>6. <B>The period of the Alliance</B> (1936 - 1943). The Kurlykistan Alliance's Auxiliary Forces of the Third Reich (KAAFTR or further simply the Alliance) is being formed, taking part in many secret special operations of the Third Reich (Sea Lion, Weserubung, etc.).</LI>
			
			<LI>7. <B>The Period of Kurlykistan</B> (1943 - 1945). The shortest period of Kurlykistan, because of this, sometimes refers to the previous period. Commander-in-chief Vorobushek Blin succeeds in founding Kurlykistan as a state and realizing the goal of Rebirth - to re-create Kurlykongard in the present times. Kurlykistan is again independent and although it exists officially, it is isolated from the outside world (xenophobia). Interrupted by the attack of Tomatoland, the Great Battle of Kurlykistan and further by the advance of the Red Army on Berlin and neighboring territories.</LI>
			<LI>8. <B>The Period of the Second Silence</B> (1945 - present). Kurlykistan again goes into a silence after a somewhat unsuccessful rebirth and unites with Tomatoland. It exists as an underground organization with headquarters in the shelter (and possibly unidentified societies outside), codenamed "Ovoschnaya Telezhka". The Kurlykistan movement is promoted by Rey Ogurets, like the Commander-in-Chief Vorobushek, but more closed. There are plans to establish the United Kurlykistan Nation, but they are not yet feasible.</LI>
