		<PRE>A voice is coming from the ashes.
The eye can see the ones who died.
You may not speak, but hear the flashes,
The darkness always comes inside.

The taste of blood unlocks a question.
There's nothing else, there's nothing left.
The words flow through, without a passion,
But cautious, falling to the cleft.

I've closed the door that leads to answers,
Locked with a key that isn't real.
Lies that surround me feel like cancer -
There is no cure. There's no repeal.

As I continue being sated,
The ones around me scream and cry.
The door comes closer every second,
To whisper me the last goodbye.

The voice is calling from the ground.
It's calling me. It screams my name.
The hope I lost was never found.
I failed myself. I lost my game.

Before my eyes, I saw my torment.
However, I did not confess.
Without my word. Without my consent,
My life has crumbled to my past.

And I accepted all the torture.
I went with it, and I got used.
The road had ended, like my fortune.
It's only me, who got accused.

But then I see it - clear and shining.
The truth, that pierces naked eye.
I say my name. I see arrival.
The darkness always comes inside.

Oh, master! Never would I follow
The deathly voice, the caller's herd.
Although I fear my heart is hollow,
My wrath is all I can afford.

While tearing up, I beg forgiveness,
For all my past to not return.
I beg to be the only witness.
I beg to be the one who'll burn.

And though I know that you forbid it,
Let me for once to be the judge!
Let me to be the one who'll feel it,
Evoking my eternal grudge.

I praise your word, I'll serve my sentence!..
Forever curse the one who died.
The flashes blinded my repentance,
For those of darkness fear their light.

The voice is coming from my mouth,
From sacred places down below.
It asks for things to cry about,
For though it screams, the pain is slow.

The gust of blood I had not tasted
Fulfilled my lungs up to the brim.
Of all the days I could've wasted
The one tomorrow was on scene.

I watched the stage for years and ages,
Forever trying to forget...
There are no words to fill the pages.
There's only pain you can accept.</PRE>
