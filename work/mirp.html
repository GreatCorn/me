		<HR>
		<P><B>FORM: </B>Utility</P>
		<P><B>LATEST UPDATE: </B>31.07.2020 (v1.6.8.3)</P>
		<P><B>CREATION DATE: </B>15.11.2019</P>
		<P><B>DESCRIPTION: </B>Converts MIDI input into keystrokes, adapted to be used with Roblox Virtual Piano. Also supports different programmable keyboard layouts and MIDI file playing. First programmed in Python using PyGame, later Mido. Since version 1.5.6.6 was reprogrammed on Object Pascal, using Lazarus LCL and Windows functions for MIDI input and keystroke simulation.</P>
		<P>This program uses MIDI input to get note data. Upon running MIRP when a device is connected it will test for any input and then will convert it into keystrokes with the appropriate layout. The text will display what note number was sent the latest and what symbol that corresponds to on the keyboard with the current chosen layout. In the program, to get a hint on what an element does, simply hover your cursor over it.</P>
		<P>You can design your own layout for MIRP to use. Prior version 1.6.8.3 it had to be done in another app called MIRP Layout Designer, but after 1.6.8.3 its features got incorporated into the main program.</P>
		<P>No, there most likely won't be a Linux version any time soon and definitely no MacOS version. Sorry. My PC is too bad for a reliable virtual machine and the functions and procedures are different on every platform, on which I've never developed. I'm sorry, but that's just how it is. Also please forgive me for disabling the comments on the video, I just don't really like that most of my notifications are from that mess of a video and the comments which report problems don't do it coherently and some without any elaboration whatsoever. If you have any clear, formed questions, please message me using any of the links you can find in the <A href="/me/contacts/">CONTACTS</A> section of this website.</P>
