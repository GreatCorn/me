		<P><B>LATEST UPDATE: </B>11.03.2020</P>
		<P><B>CREATION DATE: </B>11.03.2020</P>
		<P><B>DESCRIPTION: </B>That's it. Literally.</P>
		<P>Well, I had a profile picture (most likely only on my Skype), on which I drew myself hanging on a rope in an attempt of suicide, but in a more humorous way. The site is basically that profile picture, only animated and interactable (move your mouse around or slide your finger). The site doesn't use HTML canvases, so it may be a bit laggy on some devices.</P>
		<P>The GitHub repo, on which the page was hosted also served me somewhat as a personal website, on which I first posted the WIP verion of the <A href="/me/work/peccataGallery.html">Peccata Digital Gallery</A>. The website also has an HTML recreation of <A href="https://greatcorn.github.io/greatcornhunghimself/pong2.html">Pong</A>, also without using canvases; a WIP Russian to <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan.html">Kurlykistanian</A> <A href="https://greatcorn.github.io/greatcornhunghimself/translator/">translator</A> and a WIP <A href="https://greatcorn.github.io/greatcornhunghimself/SCP-087-B/">SCP-087-B port</A>.</P>
		<P>I was also planning to post my recreation of Windows (XP/2000) <A href="/me/work/minesweeper.html">Minesweeper</A> there, but accidentally posted it to S-COM.</P>
