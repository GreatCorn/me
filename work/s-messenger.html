		<P><B>LATEST UPDATE: </B>19.03.2020</P>
		<P><B>CREATION DATE: </B>02.03.2020</P>
		<P><B>DESCRIPTION: </B>A fully functional WebSocket chat, based on the SCP Foundation and <A href="http://www.scpcbgame.com/">SCP - Containment Breach</A> (S-COM SOFTWARE 1.5). The chat first had a default WebSocket address, from a WebSocket hosting service. Later, the service started providing full functionality to only paid WebSocket addresses. Generally, the chat still works fine with any WSS WebSockets. The chat can also be installed as a Chrome app.</P>
		<P>The idea first came as an S-COM SOFTWARE 1.3 HTML recreation. Hosted on the same GitHub repo, <A href="https://greatcorn.github.io/scom/">greatcorn.github.io/scom/</A> has a somewhat functional WebSocket chat attempt, while also recreating the looks and feels of the S-COM SOFTWARE 1.3. Later an attempt was made to recreate the later version, 1.5. <A href="https://greatcorn.github.io/scom/scom15.html">greatcorn.github.io/scom/scom15.html</A> has a working desktop system, the S-Messenger built into it and the first attempt to create an SCP-themed programming language, <A href="/me/work/sccol.html">SCCOL</A>, in the form of a console.</P>
