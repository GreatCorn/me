		<H2>SV (Sancta Vita)</H2>
		<P><IMG class=Picture src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanSV.png" width=128 style="float: left">In Kurlykistan lore, SV (Sancta Vita (lat. Sacred Life) is a secret cult with assumed to be malicious intents, committing illegal political actions inside and outside Kurlykistan. Little is known about it, but they are told to be worshipping life and the pleasure given by it (often sexual), hedonism, rejecting Åotir Mundý. Many organizations' headquarters were revealed on the outskirts and borders of Kurlykistan and a couple inside. Some political agents were suspected to be members of SV, but only Oroleg Liotchek, mayor of Mivinuvo (Мивинъво) (1944-1945) was confirmed to be one. The cult's first mentions lead back to ca. 1870.</P>
		<P>In Kurlykistan-<A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A> lore, the cult worships its own pantheon, called "Stomotodika", some of the deities are described here:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><B>Shnurpshyk</B> – an incomprehensible, possibly omnipotent entity. The motives of it are unknown and are feared of, alike to its visual appearance, though the only fact known about it is that its height "in ordinary conditions" is ~30cm (1′). Said to appear mostly in dreams, but its representation may be present in the real world, unknown to anyone.</LI>
			<LI><B>Bugyl</B> – an omnipresent entity. Assumed to be large, yet no approximated measurements are specified. It is said to produce a low-frequency, gurgling sound, but as no one has documented it nor the witnessing of the Bugyl, it is unknown exactly, how the sound can be produced. Described to be less powerful, than Shnurpshyk.</LI>
			<LI><B>Kolob</B> – an entity that is said to take a child's fate into its hands after one invites it into their home. The way fate will turn is unknown. No descriptions of its motives nor visual appearances exist.</LI>
			<LI><B>Webubychko</B> – a lurking entity that is said to await us at every corner, yet we never come in contact with it. The moment Webubychko reveals itself is when a person meets their death. To "release Webubychko" is to return back to life with the awareness of death as its end and to continue getting the most enjoyment out of it.</LI>
			<LI><B>Khoojekhbyh</B> – an incomprehensible entity, said to be the representation of madness, insanity. Those, who witness it lose their mind. The only close to coherent descriptions of its visual appearance, given by the mentally unstable are: "as big as a college meeting" and "arms like legs, but all of them".</LI>
			<LI><B>Biskalele</B> – said to be the sun itself, as a sentient entity.</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>The exact ways these are worshipped are unknown, as there are no documented records of SV meetings and ceremonies.</P>
		<P>The SV is documented to use its own word formations, systematized by Kurlykistan in its language as the following analysis:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><B>Authenticity:</B> <I>natural</I> (naturally formed by the people, not intentionally, half-intentionally); <I>half-natural</I> (formed intentially by the people); <I>artificial</I> (not formed by the people).</LI>
			<LI><B>Kind:</B> if the word is natural of half-natural, from which 1st degree word it derives.</LI>
			<LI><B>Degree:</B> is determined by the amount of alterations from the initial word, if derivative. If completely new, then the 1st degree is assigned.</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>Example: "вудыло есм полунатурен стомотодичен бугыловиден терен степени" (woodylo is a half-natural stomotodical bugyl-kind word of the 3rd degree).</P>
