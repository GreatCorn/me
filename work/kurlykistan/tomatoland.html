		<HR>
		<P>In the Kurlykistan lore, a rivaling nation, home for the subjimere race. Later, by the will of the <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Great Tomato</A>, a giant futuristic airship. I don't know, he didn't send me any stuff or info about Tomatoland, I know it's rude to elicit information, but I asked three or more times. I mean, I don't really want to obtrude or something, but I just wanted to document the Tomatoland. <A href="/me/friends/greatTomato.html">Tomato</A>'s a nice guy and smart too, he told me quite a bit about the sci-fi stuff in Tomatoland, like when they found another livable planet and tried to transport their supplies there through an unstable wormhole, or how there were many different parallel universes; but due to my crappy memory I didn't remember anything. Yeah, I'm sorry, just don't know what to put here really.</P>
