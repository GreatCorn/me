		<P>The history of Kurlykistan is now divided into eight periods:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheOldBeginnings" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheOldBeginnings"><B>Period of the Old Beginnings</B></A> (up to the VIII century AD). The exact beginning of this period is unknown. It did not have such a thing as Kurlykistan, or even Kurlykongard. The Cyrian race existed, but did not have large-scale associations. There were small "councils", the largest of which contained up to thirty Cyrians. They were scattered all over the world, the languages ​​of different peoples mixed and smoothly made the beginnings of the language, later known as Khbvryliss (Kurlykongard meraia), but for the most part Latin and Scandinavian roots dominated.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheFourBrotherhoods" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheFourBrotherhoods"><B>Period of the Four Brotherhoods</B></A> (VIII - XI century). According to the Old Kurlykongard religion of the four worlds (Åotir Mundý), four large-scale brotherhoods based on the four Cröa settled, giving the previously anarchic and weak Cyrian people strength and control. The Cyrian Regiments appear, the lands that the Brotherhoods own and give the Cyrians a place to live and freedom of life. The regiments did not have exact names, they were formed among the people and later became the names of the cities of Kurlykongard.
			<BR>
			  <A id="TheBrotherhoodOfAotor" class=NavBarLink href="#TheBrotherhoodOfAotor"><IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" width=32>The Brotherhood of Aötor</A> - the Cröa of the upper world, was located in the northern parts of the Cyrian reigns and looked more like a closed society, trying to contact less with the other brotherhoods and, thereby, isolating itself in the mountains and considering themselves descendants of the Cröa. There, they created a closed council to rule over the Cyrians under the mountains. Because of this, not much is known about the Ayotor brotherhood.
			<BR>
			  <A id="TheBrotherhoodOfTorlagg" class=NavBarLink href="#TheBrotherhoodOfTorlagg"><IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(90deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Törlagg</A> - the Cröa of our civilized world, ruled the central, western and northeastern parts of the Regiments. It drew up councils for solving questions about people, agriculture, collective farm, etc. This brotherhood ruled over most of the Cyrian people, it was with it that Khbvryliss was built, but in rewriting the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Aötor Brotherhood appropriated it.
			<BR>
			  <A id="TheBrotherhoodOfSylv" class=NavBarLink href="#TheBrotherhoodOfSylv"><IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(270deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Sýlv</A> - the Cröa of our wild world, was located in the forests of the central-eastern parts of the Regiments. Like the Brotherhood of Aötor, the Brotherhood of Sýlv was like a closed society, although in this case, a tribe. While the members of the Aötor Brotherhood were presented as superior, sophisticated individuals, the members of the Sýlv Brotherhood were wild Cyrians who had left civilization. Because of this, in some sources about the history of the Four Brotherhoods, the Sýlv Brotherhood was called a tribe.
			<BR>
			  <A id="TheBrotherhoodOfNeqaotor" class=NavBarLink href="#TheBrotherhoodOfNeqaotor"><IMG src="/me/work/storage/KurlykistanBrotherhood.png" style="transform: rotate(180deg)" width=32>The Brotherhood of Neqaötor</A> - the Cröa of the lower world, ruled the southern parts. This brotherhood, just like the Brotherhood of Aötor, considered itself the descendants of the Cröa, but instead of isolating itself from the people and not personally intruding into their lives, it featured dictatorship, chauvinism, and discrimination of certain subspecies. In the 10th century, slave trade began to flourish.
			<BR>
			Closer to the IX-X centuries, the Khbvryliss language was formed.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="TheKurlykongardPeriod" class=NavBarLink href="#TheKurlykongardPeriod"><B>The Kurlykongard Period</B></A> (XI - XIV century). During this period the Cyrian Regiments were founded into a separate, independent state. The first Cyrian alliance is cited and later Kurlykongard founded as a nation by Genegorn the Lion Sphincter. The Brotherhoods unite and form one domain, although still divided into four parts, but acting in one council. The slave trade is punishable by law after the Cyrian Rights are written out. Separate cities and settlements were formed. Kurlykongard becomes an empire under the rule of the Gard family. Around the end of the XIII century, the southern parts of Kurlykongard were invaded by the reign of the subjimeres under the leadership of Tomataar Tukarvestnik the Elder. After that, religion also changes significantly: worshipping of the Cröa changes by worshipping of the four worlds themselves. Birds from the genus of true sparrows (Passer) are considered sacred, as representatives of the upper world, and their desecration is despised by the Kurlykongard Occluse. Desecration of crustaceans from the genus of real shrimp (Caridea), representatives of the lower world, is also despised. The ideologies of the Brotherhoods of Törlagg and Sýlv (mainly Törlagg) are moving out in front and the Cyrians under the government cease (at least openly) to refer themselves to the Cröa.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheFallOfGardOrTheGreatSilence" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheFallOfGardOrTheGreatSilence"><B>Period of the Fall of Gard or the Great Silence</B></A> (XIV - XIX century). After the Great Kurlykongard War and the extermination of the entire Gard family, Kurlykongard is disintegrated as an empire and soon as a nation. It exists in isolation from the environment and again in separate alliances that work only for their own good and do not invade the interests of others. It is believed that Kurlykongard is dying out, but in fact it continues to exist in a silence. Smoothly Kurlykongard changes to Kurlykistan and under the influence of the surrounding world, the Kurlykistanian language is created, spreading mostly in the southern and eastern regions. There are Ъ (pure, later Vyalenyy Pirog) and Ь (pure, later Tvorozhnoye Myaso) and dialects: ÖЪ (Blyat), Å (Schwedishe), ЪЬ (Zarena Kaczelja), ÖЬ (Blyachi Pruzhinski), etc.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheRebirth" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheRebirth"><B>Period of the Rebirth</B></A> (XIX century - 1936). In this period and beyond, the main idea of ​​Kurlykistan is rebirth, that is, again founding as a nation. Gradually, small alliances are formed into larger ones. Cooperative communities are formed with Nekoland at the head of <A href="/me/friends/misha.html">Feldwebel Voron Shnurok (later Jewish Cat)</A>.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheAlliance" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheAlliance"><B>Period of the Alliance</B></A> (1936 - 1943). The Kurlykistan Alliance's Auxiliary Forces of the Third Reich (KAAFTR or further simply the Alliance) is being formed, taking part in many secret special operations of the Third Reich (Sea Lion, Weserubung, etc.).</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="ThePeriodOfKurlykistan" class=NavBarLink href="#ThePeriodOfKurlykistan"><B>The Period of Kurlykistan</B></A> (1943 - 1945). The shortest period of Kurlykistan, because of this, sometimes refers to the previous period. Commander-in-chief Vorobushek Blin succeeds in founding Kurlykistan as a nation and achieving the goal of Rebirth - to re-create Kurlykongard as a cyrian nation in the present times. Kurlykistan gains official independency, but the inside rule is still under the Third Reich. The Kurlykistanian government wants to achieve full independence without the oppression and control of the Reich and for that secretly starts sending the Reich's plans and tactics to the USSR in order to help it lose the war. The SV cult, believing in the Reich's supremacy, intercepts the communication and answers to Kurlykistanian as if representing the Soviet Union, which in reality doesn't get any information from Kurlykistan. The neighboring <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A>, previously being a trade partner and a gateway to resource exporting to the Scandinavian countries and Western Europe with the cyrian lands is now under involuntary oppression from Kurlykistan by the rule of the Reich for not accepting its side. In the end, <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A> counterattacks Kurlykistan and weakens its defense, the Red Army captures Berlin and neighboring territories, advancing north to Kurlykistan, seeing it as an axis nation still in the alliance with the Third Reich and Kurlykistan is forced to hide in silence. The <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A> government calls its people to stay and defend the nation but is then taken by Kurlykistan into the shelter.</LI>
			
			<LI><A id="PeriodOfTheSecondSilence" class=NavBarLink href="#PeriodOfTheSecondSilence"><B>Period of the Second Silence</B></A> (1945 - 2021). Kurlykistan again goes into a silence after a somewhat unsuccessful rebirth and unites with <A href="/me/work/kurlykistan/tomatoland.html">Tomatoland</A>. It exists as an underground organization with headquarters in the shelter (and possibly unidentified societies outside), codenamed "Ovoschnaya Telezhka". The Kurlykistan movement is promoted by <A href="/me/friends/rey.html">Rey Ogurets</A>, like the Commander-in-Chief Vorobushek, but more closed. There are plans to establish the United Kurlykistan Nation, but they are not yet feasible.</LI>
