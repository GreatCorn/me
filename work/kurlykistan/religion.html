		<HR>
		<P>According to the Cyrian religion, life is divided into four worlds. The upper world, symbolizing the highness, the sky, the ether; our two, middle worlds -  one symbolizing our civilization and development as a separate nation, the other - the wild earthly nature, the earth; and the last, lower world, symbolizing the nether dark dungeons where evil lurks, and where do those who have done evil go after death. The four worlds exist in harmony, where without one there would be no other. In the Kurlykongard Okklus, this concept was used in the same way as it is now, but in a slightly different direction. From a historical point of view, it is not known where the Cyrian race came from, there are various hypotheses and theories, both scientific and religious.</P>
		
		<P>"And the land was free, but there was no rest on it. Chaos and incoherence reigned over the earth, and the earth suffered from that. Then, four brothers were born. The sun's rays weaved the first brother, Aötor, and he sat down on the throne in order to reign over the heavens and the highest and give peace to those who left this land, anyhow to be reborn in the future. A second brother, Neqaötor, came out of the waves and sat on the underground throne, where he ruled evil and punished those who left this earth with a vicious soul. The rustle of grass and foliage weaved the third brother, Sýlv, who came out of a pine tree in order to rule nature and the living and give fruit to the hungry and in need. And three brothers gathered together and created the fourth, Törlagg. And there was in him a free bird from the upper world, and there was justice in him from the lower world, and there was in him the strength and power of the earth. And the fourth brother got up and created his own kind, anyhow to rule over them. And where Aötor walked, the morning reigned, and where Neqaötor walked, night reigned there. Where Sýlv walked, greenery grew and trees bloomed. And where Törlagg walked, its own Cyrian life advanced."</P>
		
		<P>According to the Cyrian religion, the four Cröa created the Cyrian race. They were in agreement and harmony, and each ruled their own world. The four worlds were interconnected with each other, and this concept formed the Ring of Concord, which is the symbol of the Cyrian religion. The four points are completely connected to each other and enclosed in a circle. The symbol was often used in the Kurlykongard Okklus and further in the Kurlykistan national emblem and flag. There is also the concept of heaven and hell in the Cyrian religion, but they believe in rebirth, even after falling into the lower world. Cyrians believe in a system of accumulating good and evil deeds and later revenge on the evil soul.</P>
		
		<P>"And the stork went out and said his word, that Aötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
		- Ayotor told me about good deeds and about the need to accomplish them, for when a soul leaves the life of ours, judgment will befall and determine who is worthy of the highest, and who is obliged to suffer for the evil they have done. And I will name before you 8 decrees about good:<BR>
		<OL>
			<LI>Grant mutual understanding to your neighbor and friend, and guide him on the right path.</LI>
			<LI>Understand your friend that has done evil against you or others, but forgive him, for he did not know what he was doing.</LI>
			<LI>Show concern not only for yourself but also for your friend, do not lower the value of yourself and your own kind.</LI>
			<LI>Be ready to help your neighbor and your friend at any moment.</LI>
			<LI>Find an opposite friend and grant them as much happiness as only Aötor himself can bestow, and may a new soul come into this world.</LI>
			<LI>Be able to accept another who is not like you and judge the essence by his soul, and not by his appearance.</LI>
			<LI>Grant life not only to your own kind, but also to the surrounding nature, and its gifts will befall you.</LI>
			<LI>Honor the Cröa of the highest, and they will bless you with their gifts.</LI>
		</OL>
		
		And the stork finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it. And the ostrich came out and said his word, that Neqaötor came down to him and spoke to him himself.<BR>
		- Nekyotor spoke to me, but about the deeds of evil, and about the need to bypass them, for during the trial between the worlds when there are more deeds of these than good intentions, we will be punished cruelly by the boiling underground sea and we will be in torment there until we atone for all the guilt of ours. And I will name before you 8 decrees about evil:<BR>
		<OL>
			<LI>Do not defile another, neither with an evil deed, nor a bad word, nor a mighty blow.</LI>
			<LI>Do not defile the thought of one behind his back in front of others.</LI>
			<LI>Do not steal from another neither a golden kurlyk nor the good glory.</LI>
			<LI>Do not skimp on others that are in need and request.</LI>
			<LI>Do not hold evil about another, for all this evil will return to you.</LI>
			<LI>Do not defile your environment and nature, for you will live in it.</LI>
			<LI>Do not be prideful of yourself, and do not put yourself above the Cröa of the highest.</LI>
			<LI>Do not ask the Cröa for an evil gift in order to defile your neighbor or your friend.</LI>
		</OL>
		
		And the ostrich finished his word, and the Cyrians approved it.</P>
		<P>The Cyrian religion is free; they do not have to constantly and regularly pray to the Cröa. The Cyrians believed more in good relationships between each other and in helping nature.</P>
