		<PRE>My sorrow fulfills an unpleasant desire.
I suffered forever and all for too long.
Though I didn't think I would ever aquire
Such wrathful accusers who follow along.
My life is a play and the world is satire,
But you are all truthful and I'm the one wrong.

You keep me alive and you fuel my passion,
But wounded my heart is and it brings me pain.
I'd like to express deep affection, attraction,
But all I acknowledge is simply in vain,
For not anymore I remember compassion
And would not, regardless, remember again.

I hate you, I pity the ones who stay with me
Destroying my mindset and keeping me well.
I can not convey my respect, please, forgive me,
I am not unable, there's nothing to tell.
Though I disavow all your efforts completely,
You simply continue in bringing me hell.

You want me to join, you can't take me leaving.
I see constant smiling, I witness your joy.
My name is a liar, my words are deceiving,
And I am a person who you should avoid.
In spite of it all, there is no hidden meaning.
It's all blatant lies of an unashamed voice.

But nevertheless, though your manners are forceful,
I still would wake up and observe my disgrace.
I still would not be even slightly remorseful
For all of my loathing and hate for your praise.
Your words and your actions may make me immortal,
But I will despise you the rest of my days.

I deeply regret my decisions, admiring
Dispassionate life in which I don't belong.
But who made the choice? No one ever inquired.
The answer was lost in an unconcerned throng.
My life is a play and the world is satire,
But you are all truthful and I'm the one wrong.</PRE>

		<P><B>DESCRIPTION: </B>My only thoughts were of suicide and of how much I hated this life. I lived in constant anxiety and depression. Most of all, I hated the people who were dear to me and to whom I was important to in the slightest way. They kept me here. How can one be both sincerely grateful and despise someone else at the same time? This is the dilemma of the work, in which I convey my feeling of being deeply lost.</P>
